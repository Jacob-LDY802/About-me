## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading to improve load times
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
   - Target file size: < 200KB per image

2. **Use appropriate formats**
   - JPG for photos
   - PNG for images with transparency
   - WebP for best compression (with fallbacks)

3. **Responsive images**
   - Consider creating multiple sizes for different devices
   - Use `srcset` attribute in HTML for responsive images

## Placeholder Images

The website includes inline SVG placeholders, so it will work even without custom images. However, for the best presentation, add your own images following the guidelines above.
